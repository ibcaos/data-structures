# Data Structures

This repository is dedicated to practicing and implementing various data structures using the Go programming language.

## Included Data Structures

- **Linked Lists**: Implementations of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
- **Stacks**: Implementations of stacks using linked lists and arrays.
- **Queues**: Implementations of simple and double-ended queues (deques).
- **Binary Trees**: Implementations of binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and red-black trees.
- **Graphs**: Implementations of graphs using adjacency lists and adjacency matrices.
- **Hash Tables**: Implementations of hash tables with collision handling.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ibcaos/data-structures.git
    cd data-structures
    ```

2. Explore the directories and files to see the implementations of the data structures.

3. Compile and run the examples:
    ```sh
    go run linked-lists/singly_linked_list.go
    ```
